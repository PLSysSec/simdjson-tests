# simdjson-tests
This repository aims to provide a testing framework for the [simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson) library when compiling to WebAssembly (WASM) with and without SIMD Intrinsics. This build employs wasi-sdk version 16.0, WASM-Micro-Runtime (WAMR), and WebAssmebly Binary Toolkit (WABT). The `build.sh` script provides a framework for builiding the `simdjson` library to both a WASM and native target, as well as an application, `parse.cpp`, that utilizes the `simdjson` library. The script also utilizes WAMR's AOT compiler to run the application in the specified target for a configured number of runs. This generates a `csv` file with the collected execution speeds. Once all tests have been run, the `analysis.sh` script can develop statistical conclusions from the outputs.
